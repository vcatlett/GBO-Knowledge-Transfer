FastX Access
************

This is the preferred way to connect to a unix X session. Full instructions can be found `here <https://info.nrao.edu/computing/guide/network-access/fastx-remote-linux-access>`_.

When connecting using this method please avoid using the KDE window manager. It is a huge resource hog. The XFCE window manager is more lightweight and gives a better user experience.

The FastX software is licensed and we have only a limited number of seats available. For this reason it is doubly important that you terminate your session when you are done and not tie a license up. When we run out of licenses we have to start killing off sessions. If you have an idle session it may be terminated and you can lose work this way.
