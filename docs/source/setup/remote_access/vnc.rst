VNC access to the systems is still possible and instructions may be found `here <https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/gbt/observing/remote-observing-with-the-gbt>`_.

Please try and avoid using the KDE window manager. XFCE is available on all GB unix systems. If you need help with this please contact the helpdesk (helpdesk-gb@nrao.edu)

As with FastX, we would ask that you do not leave sessions logged in for days on end.
