Physical Access

The Office
==========

You will need a keycard, which will be issues by the :term:`Office Manager`.


Office Equipment
----------------

There are several cabinets of office supplies at the the entrance to the "old" wing of the Janksy Lab. Please take whatever pens, post-its, notebooks, folders, etc. you need to work effectively. Also, the countertop in front of those cabinets is known as the "free table" -- anything placed there is up for grabs. It can be a great place to find something useful, or to pass on an item that is clutter for you but may be useful for someone else.


The GBT
=======

While it is uncommon for members of the Software team to need to be on the structure, it does happen from time to time. Plus, being on the GBT is fun.

You may access the GBT as a part of a guided tour. To lead tours or go up for some other reason, you need to attend a GBT Access Training. These trainings are organized on an annual basis by the :term:`Safety Officer`. 

To access fall-protected areas of the GBT, you will need to attend a Fall Protection Training, which is hosted annually by the :term:`Safety Officer`.
