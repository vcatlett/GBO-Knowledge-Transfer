|:email:| Email Access
======================

Thunderbird is the easiest way for most Linux users to manage email and calendars. You are welcome to use whatever you want on your personal computer, of course. You can also access your email via a Web browser using Outlook at https://outlook.office365.com. 

If you ever need to find someone's email, you can do that on a Linux host with the ``lookup`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ lookup -f jensen

|:email:| Email Filters
=======================

In the Software group, we get a lot of automated emails; filters will help you deal with this deluge of information. In Thunderbird, go to Tools > Message Filters to create filters; it's pretty intuitive and will help a lot. Ctrl+Shift+K will toggle the quick filters; these are your friend.
