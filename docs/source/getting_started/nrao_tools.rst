Physical
--------

- New staff should schedule telescope safety training when possible (Safety officer); this is how you earn your white hard hat and stickers. while it is uncommon for members of the Software team to need to be on the structure, it does happen from time to time. Plus, being on the GBT is fun.
- Office equipment -- there are several cabinets of office supplies at the the entrance to the "old" wing of the Janksy Lab. Please take whatever pens, post-its, notebooks, folders, etc. you need to work effectively. Also, the countertop in front of those cabinets is known as the "free table" -- anything placed there is up for grabs. It can be a great place to find something useful, or to pass on an item that is clutter for you but may be useful for someone else.
