Utilities
=========

Water
-----

You don't have to pay a water bill! Water comes from a nearby well. It sometimes comes out with a brown color due to high iron, but it is safe to drink.


Electricity
-----------

Electricity is provided by MonPower. 


Internet and Phone
------------------

You will need to set up a landline phone number at home. There are two options for internet and phone service, Frontier and SKSRT. Pretty much everyone recommends SKSRT.
