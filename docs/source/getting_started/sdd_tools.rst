SDD-Specific Tools

Jira
====

- We plan and track our work as a group using Jira: https://gbobservatory.atlassian.net/browse/CME; it will take you straight to the correct view of things. There are some filters up at the top; you can use these to show only your issues, for example. New staff are encouraged to set an avatar that they like.

Jenkins
=======

Jenkins is our CI/CD tool. New members of the Software team can be created from the Web interface. For more information, see :ref:`Jenkins <jenkins>`.
